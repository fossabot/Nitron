## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Updates
Nitron Security updates happen usually every other week if possible. QoL (Quality of Life) updates happen almost every month. 

### Issues
If the browser encounters an error you will either get a popup saying
> Error 90B. Please contact browser customer services (contact@itsquentin.ml).

Or, you get a JavaScript Exception error.
In both of these situations, it is recommended that you either email [contact@itsquentin.ml](mailto:contact@itsquentin.ml) or go to the issues tab [here](https://github.com/ItsQuentin-Inc/Nitron/issues).

If a vulnerablity is declined as `Not Possible` or `90A` then, we do not have the resources to fix the vulnerablity or it is already fixed, and is expected to be fixed in the next QoL or Security update.
